# 📘 Web Development Learning Notes (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

Welcome 👋  
This repository contains my **personal learning notes and practice code** for **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This is a **public repository**, and anyone is free to read, learn from it, or follow along.  
The code here represents my **real learning journey**, written while actively studying and practicing.

## ✅ Current Status

### 🧱 HTML — Completed
I have completed the **basics of HTML**, including:
- Page structure
- Common elements
- Forms
- Semantic HTML

HTML files here are used as the foundation for styling and scripting.

I will go **much deeper** into CSS, including:
- Box model

### ⚙️ JavaScript — Upcoming / Ongoing
JavaScript is being added gradually, starting with:

## 🌱 What This Repository Is

- ✍️ Code written while learning (not copied tutorials)
- 📚 Notes created through practice
- 🧪 Small experiments and examples
- 🚀 Continuously updated as I improve

This is **not a polished project** — it is a **learning-in-public repository**.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

- Code may be simple or repetitive
- Structure may improve over time
- Older code may be refactored later

All of this is intentional and part of the learning process.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

- To track my learning progress
- To practice writing real code

## ⭐ Final Note

Learning web development takes time.

Write code.
Break things.
Fix them.
Repeat.

Happy coding 🚀
